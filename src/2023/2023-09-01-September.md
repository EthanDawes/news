Dear $name,

Guess who's back, back again? Ethan's back! Tell you're friends!

How's it going? In the month since we last talked, I've been quite busy!

- Printed Starship robot stickers
- Visited a street festival in Lafayette.
    - Bought a $4 taco, thinking it was a incredible bargain, only to be disappointed by minuscule taco. Should've known better in this economy
    - Watched children speed eat ice cream, which was amusing
- Watched Bollywood movie with my hall
- International roommate funny realizations:
    - Asked me if everyone in America has to be Christian (there were a lot of recruiters out)
    - Surprised that I shower at night since he thought all American guys shower in the morning
- Most useful unexpected item at college: portable dry erase board. Lets me do random scratch work on it
- Making bed on 2nd bunk is hard ðŸ˜­
- silly thing about Purdue: no building is at ground level. They all start with a staircase going up or down, such that the ground floor is slightly underground and the first floor is slightly above ground (which must be awful for accessibility)
- my evenings are consistently triple booked which is fun staying busy, but also sad since I want to do all the things ðŸ˜­
- Participated in a Game Jam! Play the game here (https://purduesiggd.github.io/game-jam-games/AntField.html) Windows only, sorry Mac users
- Learned/ing how to draw!
- got a flat earth from the conspiracy theory guy
- learning how to unicycle (by far my favorite club of the week)
- Found other people who know sign language! Practicing with them made me realize I need to study more ðŸ¥²
- Working on admin dashboard for food delivery drones
- Attended several career fairs
    - Most employers weren't looking for freshmen :( Even the ones who said they were online reversed in person
    - Incredibly packed, long lines. Tried to find smaller companies


Here are some photos which I'll update every month with my best shenanigans! Feel free to leave comments on the pictures, and I'll try to contextualize them! https://photos.app.goo.gl/ktH1rDyyrLCSSsrv9

Please do let me know what's been going on in your life, I'd love to hear it!

Sincerely,
Ethan Dawes
