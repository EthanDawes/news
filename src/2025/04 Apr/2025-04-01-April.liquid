        Salutations, $name. I've certainly ended the year with a bang!
      </p>
      <p>
        A question I like to ask my friends as the semester draws to a close is "What are you most proud of this semester?"
        For me, it has to be my new organizational method because I learned a lot, I persisted, and I believe it will have an impact.
      </p>
      <p>
        What are you proud of these past 16 weeks (since January)?

  We had everything Minecraft-themed: legos, pinata, food, swordfighting, block building, and trivia.
  Afterwards, we went to see the newly-released Minecraft movie! " %}

  Rather stressful organizing the roster, but thankful I had lots of help! 🙏 Pircured is us preparing the snack bags.
  I also went around the park with a new friend, Garv, pictured at the top!" %}

- I got an Residence Assistant (RA) position at [3rd and West](https://www.housing.purdue.edu/my-housing/options/apartments/3rd-west.html)!
It's fancy apartment-style living but still under construction, so let's hope I have a place to live 🤞😂
- Classes over & I did well in all of them!
- I'm proud of my 307 project
- Filed taxes for the first time! It was annoying and I actually owed Illinois money 😠💸

- By popular demand, the [photo album](https://albums.ethandawes.dev/?t=rFwNC3Nb#9UFc5aBHAXAaMjKKiDeVHQgFM3ffacsoep31mfkrZaKA) is back! 📸
