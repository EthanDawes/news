- I got the RA position in [Third and West](https://www.housing.purdue.edu/my-housing/options/apartments/3rd-west.html) 🥳. It's a new building so I don't know what to expect.
- Competed in a Just Dance bracket! Unfortunately, I got immediately eliminated 😞, but I stayed around to watch
- Acted in a Maslenitsa (Slavic holiday celebrating the coming of spring) play as the kolobok (similar to the gingerbread man)
- Ate lots of good Asian food thanks to Agnes (plus the obligatory stop for a $1.50 Costco hot dog! 🌭)
- Unfortunately, the photo album is down because it was too much effort for me to edit
