        WE'RE SO BACK, $name!!! 🔥 This may be my busiest semester yet, but I wouldn't want it any other way 🔥🔥🔥🏋️💪

        Oh, my summer? Estonia, Iceland, and Romania were all very fun BUT NO TIME!!! Plus, I gotta leave something to talk about 😉.
        There's some photos are in the album if you want to peek though.

        It's been a hot minute, so what have you been up to? A question my job likes to ask me and which is now my favorite question, is
        "how have you grown in your job/the past year" (whichever is more applicable)
