            We made it! ü•≥ My third semester came and went in a flash. I'm incredibly relieved to have a break at last cuz so much has happened! For instance, I met the president of Purdue University, Mung Chiang! ü§© He's a pretty cool guy and cares about student issues. What are your plans for break?

          <mj-text>My event, RHA Finals Frost Fest included a gingerbread house building contest and lots of free food. The winner was my friend El's depiction of Purdue Pete getting run over by a train. I was so busy during the event that I didn't even get time to make my own house ‚òπÔ∏è (don't worry, I got one to go). Afterwards, only 2 people helped clean, would not do that again.</mj-text>
