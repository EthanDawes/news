Dear $name,

Hello! I'm hope you're doing well! I've been at Purdue for a little over 2 weeks now, and it's been very cool! As I write this, someone is playing the piano in the common room, which is pleasant. Classes have yet to ramp up in difficulty, which I'm thankful for. I've heard a lot of bad things about calc 2 and discrete math, both of which I'm taking üò¨. However, I feel confident in myself and the resources Purdue provides. In my spare time, I've been filling my schedule with club informational sessions, but it's so hard to narrow it down! There's 5 robotics teams alone! I've also been busy polishing up my resume for the Career Fair in a week ‚ÄºÔ∏è

The one class I'm looking forward to the most is definitely the Data Mine: Corporate Partners program. I'm working with a company called Injenii who uses quantum computers in medical imaging. I'm going to be working on Quantum algorithms to preprocess the images.

I definitely have my work cut out for me meeting all 40,000 people! üòÖ Thankfully, I'd say I've been doing a pretty good job of putting myself out there and meeting people through clubs and the cultural centers. Fun fact, I'm learning how to juggle in a club! I'll have to show you sometime when I see you! I'm also really thankful for Boiler Gold Rush, which is our orientation program. I made good friends with the people in my group.

My roommate is an international student from Vietnam, named Huy. We get along fine, but I do miss Cole though (my IMSA roommate) üò¢

Here are some photos which I'll update every month with my best shenanigans! Feel free to leave comments on the pictures, and I'll try to contextualize them! https://photos.app.goo.gl/ktH1rDyyrLCSSsrv9


Please do let me know what's been going on in your life, I'd love to hear it!

Sincerely,
Ethan Dawes
