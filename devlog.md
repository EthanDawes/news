- Wordpress with extension
    - Free [post notification](https://github.com/valeriosouza/post-notification) extension
    - Cannot use extensions for free on wordpress.com
    - Would have to self-host
    - Installation seems like a hassle
    - Would need a domain name (so my server knows which app to serve. Or, use `/path`)
    - Freenom gets bad reviews
    - Do I have enough things to say that warrant a WordPress page?
- GNU mailer
    - Restricted access
    - Does exactly what I need
    - Also need self-host, Glitch being weird (also takes up most disc space)
    - See above self-hosting problems
- Static hosting (GitHub pages)
    - free w/ domain name!
    - Cannot subscribe/unsubscribe
        - Use vercel fn?
    - Uncharted territory: action to send latest page
        - Make HTTP request to vercel endpoint?
    - Also need to add HTML support
- Add HTML support
    - Looks weird if I just use text (need css)
    - Support images!
    - Need better editor than Word b/c it doesn't conform to best practices (uses `p` for lists!? Apostrophes don't render)

Action plan: start from the bottom and move up as needs demand.
